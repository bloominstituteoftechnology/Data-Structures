For each of the methods associated with each data structure, classify it based on its worst-case runtime, using Big O notation.

## Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `add_to_tail`?

    O(c) - nothing changes based on the input

    a. What if our list implementation didn't have a reference to the tail of the list in its constructor? What would be the runtime of the `add_to_tail` method?

    Without a reference to the tail, it would require traversing the list to get to the last node which would increase it to o(n), as it would increase as the list got larger

2. What is the runtime complexity of `remove_head`?

  O(c), there is no input to change how the code will execute, and the length of
  the list will not change anything

3. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

  O(n), as the list increases, the more evaluations the code might have to perform

4. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

  O(n), same as contains

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?

  O(c), it uses linked list's add_to_tail, only adding a constant change for recording size

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?

  O(c), same as above

3. What is the runtime complexity of `len`?

  O(c), only returns a stored value

## Binary Search Tree

1. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

  O(log(n)), it isn't required to evaluate every node in the tree, only the ones
  it needs to traverse the tree to get to the needed spot

2. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

  O(log(n)), same as insert

3. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?
  O(log(n)), same as previous two questions

## Heap

1. What is the runtime complexity of `_bubble_up`?

  O(log n), recursively calls itself until it reaches the highest
  potential spot, but increasing size of heap only increases certain
  chains

2. What is the runtime complexity of `_sift_down`?

  O(log n), same as `_bubble_up` but in the opposite direction,
  down the tree as far as it can go

3. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

  O(log n), uses `_bubble_up` under the hood, but only adds constant
  additions that aren't considered in complexity

4. What is the runtime complexity of `delete`?

  O(log n), uses `_shift_down` under the hood, similar to above, only adds
  additions that don't go into complexity consideration

5. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

  O(c), returns a saved value

## [Stretch Goal] Doubly Linked List

Answer to 1-10:
  O(c), none of the methods are affected by the size of the list or input

1. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_after`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_before`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_head`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_head`?

6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_tail`?

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_front`?

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_end`?

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?

        Array.splice would be O(n) as it increases the larger the requested array section
      is. Whereas DLL's delete does not change based on list size or input.
