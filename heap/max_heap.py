maxHeap provides quickest O(1) access to largest value on the heap. Its 
helper functions, insert, bubble_up, delete and sift_down, always maintained
the largest value on the top of heap to be read.

maxHeap is based on graph structure maintaining largest value on root node and 
second largest values on second immediate tree level. 

getMax - enable O(1) fastest access to largest value on the heap.

insert and bubble_up- 
    append new value to leaf node and
    bubble_up to its appropriate value order.
delete and sift_down- 
    fetch and remove largest value on top of heap or root node.
    Replace previous largest value in root node with presumably small 
        leaf node value, so that sift_down function can rearrange the 
        small leaf node down the tree to its appropriate level.
