Answer the following questions for each of the data structures you implemented as part of this project.

## Stack

1. What is the runtime complexity of `push` using a list?
    /* `O(1)` It is because we are performing a single operation. Also, nothing has to be shifted, we only change pointers to the new tail. */

2. What is the runtime complexity of `push` using a linked list?
    /* `O(1)` It is because we are performing a single operation. Also, we only change pointers to the new head when we link */
3. What is the runtime complexity of `pop` using a list?
    /* `O(1)` It is because we are performing a single operation while calling the `size` variable in order to track the length as the list grows */
