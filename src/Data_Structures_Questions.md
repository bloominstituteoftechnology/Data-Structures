For each of the methods associated with each data structure, classify it based on its runtime, using Big O notation.

## Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `addToTail`?
                    <!-- O(n) -->
    a. What if our list implementation didn't have a reference to the tail of the list in its constructor? What would be the runtime of the `addToTail` method?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `removeHead`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`?

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?
        <!-- O(1) -->
2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `isEmpty`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `length`?

## Binary Search Tree

1. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`? 

2. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
