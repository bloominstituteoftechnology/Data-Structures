Linked List

store a list of values
isolated nodes  
(arrows are references)


First element of node is head
last element before the N is tail
N is none
number between head and tail is value

		in contrast with arrays
Pros:
	Easier to insert into and delete from the middle of a linked list compared to an array..
(WHY)

Const:
Not cache friendly 


Pro - keep adding list to the end of the list. (unlike arrays with static amount of allocated memory)





BIG 0 IS A MEASURE

Time  != Big O   <-- hardware indpendent

Hardware dependent


O(c) - constant - Best case scenario - doesnt scale at the result of the input 


SIMPLIFYING BIG 0 notation

O(c + n)  => O (cÌ¶ + n) => O(n)


STACKS -- Ordering properties
Last In First Out - LIFO (stacking dishes)
