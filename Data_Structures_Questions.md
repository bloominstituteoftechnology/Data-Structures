Answer the following questions for each of the data structures you implemented as part of this project.

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?
O(n) Linear Time due to the fact that we're using the .insert() method.

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?
 O(n) Linear Time due to the fact that dequeue is using the .pop() method.

3. What is the runtime complexity of `len`?
O(1) Constant Time because it's just reading the size property.

## Binary Search Tree

1. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

## Heap

1. What is the runtime complexity of `_bubble_up`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `_sift_down`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `delete`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

## Doubly Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_after`? 
O(1) Constant Time

2. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_before`?
O(1) Constant Time

3. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?
O(1) Constant Time

4. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_head`?
O(1) Constant Time

5. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_head`?
O(1) Constant Time

6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_tail`?
O(1) Constant Time

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?
O(1) Constant Time

O(1) Constant Time

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_end`?
O(1) Constant Time

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?
O(1) Constant Time

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
