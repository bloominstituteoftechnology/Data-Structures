    Runtime Complexity is O(1).
6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_tail`?
    Runtime complexity is O(1).
7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?
    Runtime complexity is O(1).
8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_front`?

    Runtime complexity is O(1).
    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
        Array.splice is O(n).
