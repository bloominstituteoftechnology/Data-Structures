Answer the following questions for each of the data structures you implemented as part of this project.

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?
   1. `O(1)` because we are performing a single operation

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?
   1. `O(1)` because we are performing a single operation

3. What is the runtime complexity of `len`?
   1. `O(1)` because we are performing a single operation (calling the `size` variable which tracks length)


## Binary Search Tree

1. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`? 

2. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`? 

## Heap

1. What is the runtime complexity of `_bubble_up`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `_sift_down`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `delete`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

## Doubly Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_after`?
   1. `O(1)`

2. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_before`?
   1. `O(1)`

3. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?
   1. `O(1)`

4. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_head`?
   1. `O(1)`

5. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_head`?
   1. `O(1)`

6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_tail`?
   1. `O(1)`

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?
   1. `O(1)`

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_front`?
   1. `O(1)`

9.  What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_end`?
   1. `O(1)`

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
