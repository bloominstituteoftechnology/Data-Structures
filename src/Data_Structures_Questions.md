For each of the methods associated with each data structure, classify it based on its runtime, using Big O notation.

## Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `addToTail`?
  
    a. What if our list implementation didn't have a reference to the tail of the list in its constructor? What would be the runtime of the `addToTail` method?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `removeHead`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`?

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `isEmpty`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `length`?

## Binary Search Tree

1. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`? 

2. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`? 

4. What is the runtime complexity of `depthFirstForEach`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `breadthFirstForEach`?

## Heap

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

2. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `bubbleUp`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `siftDown`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

6. What is the runtime complexity of `delete`?

7. What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`?

## [Stretch Goal] Doubly Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insertAfter`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insertBefore`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.addToHead`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.removeFromHead`?

6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.addToTail`?

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.removeFromTail`?

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.moveToFront`?

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.moveToBack`?

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
