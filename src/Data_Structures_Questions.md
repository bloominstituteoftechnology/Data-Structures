For each of the methods associated with each data structure, classify it based on its runtime, using Big O notation.

## Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `addToTail`?
  O(1)
    a. What if our list implementation didn't have a reference to the tail of the list in its constructor? What would be the runtime of the `addToTail` method? O(n)

2. What is the runtime complexity of `removeHead`?
    O(1)
3. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?
    O(n)
4. What is the runtime complexity of `getMax`?
    O(n) or O(1) (torn between these two)
## Queue

    O(1)
2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?
    O(n)
3. What is the runtime complexity of `isEmpty`?
