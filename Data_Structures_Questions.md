For each of the methods associated with each data structure, classify it based on its worst-case runtime, using Big O notation.

## Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `add_to_tail`?
  O(1)
    a. What if our list implementation didn't have a reference to the tail of the list in its constructor? What would be the runtime of the `add_to_tail` method?
    O(n) since it would need to iterate through the entire list without caching.
2. What is the runtime complexity of `remove_head`?
O(n)
3. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?
O(n)
4. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?
O(n)
